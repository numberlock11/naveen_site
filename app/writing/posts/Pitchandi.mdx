summary: 'Dad's retirement.'
---

Munuswamy Pitchandi, from Sevoor, Tamil Nadu, India hangs up his boots after 27 years of service at Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation (K.N.P.C) — over 40 years in total, having spent his professional career in Oil refining. He was good at it — extremely good. But his legacy is about how he changed the face of an entire family single-handedly during these 27 years. A family that I was fortunate to be part of, and proud to call him my dad.


My dad has never had fancy titles during his entire career, nor has he always received recognition for what he deserved. Ulterior self-less motives and astounding work ethic drove him.

This post is to celebrate the man for his glorious career, qualities that make him who he is today, and the inspiration he has been to many that worked with him and hopefully, will be to many that simply read this post.

## Hustle on 100

My dad and I had very different childhoods, and he’s entirely responsible for it. Hailing from a remote village (roughly 8000 people) in Tamil Nadu, he sort of had a home, occasionally had 3 full meals a day, worked in fields during the day when he wasn’t at school and was thankful for public electric light poles to help him study during the night. And study, he did diligently.

Things weren’t great but he was fueled with the desire to change the circumstance that he and extended family around him were in. Money wasn’t a problem in a way, because there wasn’t any. He found ways to get through school and college to to start making some of it. He started with a job in Chennai at Madras Refinery Limited (MRL) — now CPCL — finally bought a house, married my mom and had me.

When I was 4, he embarked on an ambitious journey to cross the seas to the Middle East. Different place, same goal. Undeterred by the fear of unknown, fear of failure, mounting pressure of a growing extended family to support — he marched on and did so for 27 years strong.

The extended family now has 4 Post-Graduates — including a doctor and 2 engineers. Needless to say how we got here.

## Work Ethic

I drew a lot as a kid and my parents obliged by sticking my art on the wall — regardless of how it looked. And naturally, there were a lot of cars of all sizes stuck on the wall. The consolation was that it wasn’t just me — my dad had drawings stuck on the wall too. His drawings were his refinery plan layouts. I didn’t understand back then why I had to share the wall with dad - I was the kid. Made sense a few decades later.

He would put up plans on the wall to look at them enough times to know them well without any reference. No one required him to know them by heart. But he did whatever was necessary, to be best at what he did.

My dad wouldn’t talk to anyone in the house 30 minutes before his shift either. (Oh yes, he did 27 years of shifts, 6 days a week alternating every 2 days between morning, afternoon and night). Mom later told me that was his time to get in his work mode to be 100% as soon as he walked into the refinery. It didn’t really matter what kind of work he was doing or where he was working, the fundamental values of giving your best and being your best at work is something he still holds — that I’m sure his colleagues will attest to.

## Stay Happy — By Default

We didn’t have much in my early days and for the majority of my mom and dad’s life, but we were Happy. I have vivid memories of being conscious of the day of the month to assume how much money could be left in the bank, and eagerly awaiting pay day to go shopping. In contrast to now, that seems less than ideal — but the reality was that we were truly happy. My brother and I had everything we needed, and more. The true north star for dad was always to ensure we were happy at the end of the day. Nothing else mattered to him.
His subconscious default when ending a phone call is still — Stay Happy, God Bless.
YOLO (You Live Only Once)

To truly break barriers and do something remarkable, one needs tenacity, bold vision and the courage to handle failure. For someone coming from my dad’s background, it is easy to retreat into a safe mode and impose the need to be that way onto his kids because the cost of failure could be too much to rebuild again. But my dad’s courage was unmatched in someways, he was never afraid to take risks and never limited me either. I’ve switched my career goals from wanting to be an Automobile Designer -> Visual Effects Artist -> Pilot, and he has never once said No to a single one of them. My brother and I have always been left alone to chase our dreams.

He realized his knowledge of the world was limited to Chemical Engineering and his refinery, and so encouraged us to discover, learn and find mentors for ourselves who could help us further our pursuit of desires. And I found mine when I was 10 years old — an uncle named Sudhakar who taught me enough about Computers to know I was very much a techie by heart. The humility to know his limits and not impose them on my brother or I is remarkable, but the larger message I suppose was really — YOLO — or in his words in Tamil :

>> எதுவா இருந்தாலும் பாத்துக்கலாம்
>> We’ll handle whatever happens

It is only after these many years, as I relate my personal experiences and introspect on my strengths and achievements in my career, I can connect the dots back to where they came from. So for those who work with me and see me exhibit any of the above, this is why. I’ve never been the smartest kid in any room — I still am not — But I do know I’m the most hardworking kid in the block, relentless and not afraid to fail. I recall my experience being the best table and chair arranger at my first part-time job as event organizer at Grad School — didn’t matter what the job was, I just knew I wanted to be the best at it. Now as I connect the dots backwards — it all makes sense.

## Not alone…

This whole post was meant to be dedicated to my dad on his last working day. But it would be injustice to not talk about the one who has constantly grounded us with stories of our humble upbringing, reminded us about what is real, sacrificed her entire life in isolation in a desert and sometimes years apart from dad so we could have good education — my mom.

In all fairness, we could call this a longstanding cricket test match partnership inning being declared. So this retirement isn’t just for Dad, fair to say both Dad and Mom retire today.

*Pitchandi and Indira — Declare and walk back to the pavilion!*

Without either of them holding their ground and making the sacrifices that they did, our entire family wouldn’t be in a position we are in today. My cousin can afford to open a clinic to treat patients, I drive a Tesla, and my brother rents an apartment in the middle of Melbourne city.

I’m sure all of the above would’ve been a dream in their eyes decades ago, and in their minds wishing “One day”.

It’s One Day today.

My dad loves Tamil poems and Thirukkural. And so if I may quote them for his happiness, and remind him that they have all come true :

> தம்மின் தம்மக்கள் அறிவுடமை மா நிலத்து
மன்னுயிர்க்கு எல்லாம் இனிது

> If the children’s intelligence is more than that of parents,
It will be a joy to all the living beings of the earth

மகன் தந்தைக்கு ஆற்றும் உதவி இவன் தந்தை
என்நோற்றான் கொல்எனும் சொல்

The duty of the children is to make other people to exclaim,

“what prayers the parents had done to give birth to these valuable children”
In another 2 months I’m about to have a child of my own and I hope to have at least half as much impact as he has had on our lives.

Mom and Dad,

You’ve done your part and more. It’s time to finally sit back and enjoy your own lives — something you’ve kept aside for 27 years so others can be well today.

Cheers,
Naveen and Akil.
